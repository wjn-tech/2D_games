# Proposal: World Chronometer and Weather

Implement a synchronized global calendar and dynamic weather system with environmental effects.

## Why
Living worlds need a sense of time and changing conditions to affect social life (aging) and physical systems (fire spreading/extinguishing).

## Proposed Changes
1.  **Global Calendar**: Tracks minutes, hours, days, and years.
2.  **Weather Engine**: Uses probability tables to transition between Clear, Rain, and Storm.
3.  **Visual Feedback**: Parallax-integrated weather overlays (Rain particles, Thunder flashes).

## Impact
- **Gameplay**: Weather affects visibility and elemental chemistry.
- **Narrative**: Chronometer drives the lineage succession cycle.

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] Time advances in-game and triggers "Day Over" signals.
- [ ] Random weather changes occur based on a weighted probability table.
