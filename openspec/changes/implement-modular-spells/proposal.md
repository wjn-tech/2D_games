# Proposal: Modular Spell and Wand System

Introduce a deep, customizable combat system based on programmable wands and spell cards.

## Why
Allows for immense player creativity in combat, moving beyond simple weapon tiers.

## Proposed Changes
1.  **Wand Resource**: Stores capacity, recharge rate, and spell slots.
2.  **Spell Resource**: "Cards" that act as projectiles or modifiers.
3.  **Wand Interpreter**: Executes the sequence of spells in a wand.

## Impact
- **Combat**: Tactical depth.
- **Loot**: Exploration incentive to find rare spells.

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] A wand can cast a basic projectile (e.g., Spark).
- [ ] A modifier (e.g., Double) increases the count of the next projectile.
