# Polish Main Menu Experience

## Summary
This proposal aims to elevate the "Star Ocean Journey" Main Menu from a functional prototype to a polished, immersive sci-fi experience. It addresses specific critiques regarding visual hierarchy, interaction feedback, color palette, and atmospheric depth.

## Motivation
The current main menu lacks the "Star Ocean" atmosphere.
- **Hierarchy**: Title and buttons feel disconnected; alignment is messy.
- **Interaction**: Buttons feel flat; "Start Game" lacks prominence.
- **Visuals**: Black icons and cheap colors clash with the sci-fi theme.
- **Atmosphere**: The background is too sparse (just white dots).

## Proposed Changes
1.  **Visual Overhaul**:
    -   Adopt a deep "Sci-Fi" palette (Deep Blue, Cyan, localized Gold for "Start").
    -   Tint icons to match the theme (remove black silhouettes).
    -   Improve alignment and spacing of menu items.
2.  **Atmosphere**:
    -   Add a background "Nebula" layer (static or shader-based) to add depth behind the stars.
    -   Add a connecting visual element between the Title and the Menu.
3.  **Animation**:
    -   Implement an **Entrance Animation**: Staggered fade-in/slide-up for title and buttons on scene load.
    -   Enhance hover effects with stronger glow or color shifts.
