# Wand Icons Spec

## ADDED Requirements

Undecorated wands SHALL display `wand_base.svg` instead of `icon.svg` when no visual blocks are present.

#### Scenario: New Wand
When a player crafts or receives a new wand with an empty visual grid:
1. The inventory icon for the wand is set to `wand_base.svg`.
2. The Godot placeholder `icon.svg` is NOT used.

#### Scenario: Decorated Wand
When a player modifies a wand to add at least one visual block:
1. The inventory icon updates to the texture generated by `WandTextureGenerator`.
2. The generated texture reflects the grid contents.
