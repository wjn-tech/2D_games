# Roadmap: 15-Sub-Project Implementation Plan

📅 **Project Overview**: Multi-dimensional Open World Simulation Game
**Architecture**: Layered TileMap + Physical System (Godot 4.5)
**Duration**: 24 Months (5 Phases)

## Phase 1: Foundation (1-4 Months)
*Milestone 1: Basic framework done; 3-layer movement and time progression functional.*

1.  **[01-physics-layer-architecture](01-physics-layer-architecture/)** (6 Weeks): 3-layer TileMap collision, dynamic layer switching, raycast optimization.
2.  **[02-character-attribute-engine](02-character-attribute-engine/)** (5 Weeks): Growth curves, FSM integration, combat formulas.
3.  **[03-world-chronometer-and-weather](03-world-chronometer-and-weather/)** (4 Weeks): Time system, weather probability tables, environment VFX.

## Phase 2: World Interaction & Survival (5-8 Months)
*Milestone 2: Survival loop (Gather-Trade-Combat) complete; NPCs interactive.*

4.  **[04-npc-behavior-and-factions](04-npc-behavior-and-factions/)** (7 Weeks): FSM/Behavior Tree, faction relationship matrix, debugging tools.
5.  **[05-resource-gathering-and-ecology](05-resource-gathering-and-ecology/)** (6 Weeks): Generation algorithms, ecology chain, dynamic regrowth logic.
6.  **[06-trading-and-economy](06-trading-and-economy/)** (5 Weeks): Inventory system, dynamic pricing algorithm, trading UI.

## Phase 3: Manufacturing & Construction (9-12 Months)
*Milestone 3: Bases can be built; weapons manufactured; vertical tactical combat functional.*

7.  **[07-crafting-forging-alchemy](07-crafting-forging-alchemy/)** (6 Weeks): Recipe editor, synthesis logic, quality RNG system.
8.  **[08-building-and-city-blueprint](08-building-and-city-blueprint/)** (8 Weeks): Grid building logic, city range detection, preview system.
9.  **[09-layer-combat-mechanics](09-layer-combat-mechanics/)** (5 Weeks): Depth switching doors, vertical AI, multi-layer pathfinding.

## Phase 4: Social & Lineage (13-16 Months)
*Milestone 4: Full lifecycle (Birth-Growth-Marriage-Breeding-Death-Succession).*

10. **[10-social-marriage-system](10-social-marriage-system/)** (5 Weeks): Affinity algorithm, marriage event chains, spouse AI adjustments.
11. **[11-heredity-and-breeding](11-heredity-and-breeding/)** (6 Weeks): Genetic algorithms, infant growth simulation, family tree UI.
12. **[12-succession-and-legacy](12-succession-and-legacy/)** (4 Weeks): Succession logic, inheritance distribution, skill transfer.

## Phase 5: Advanced Automation & Tactics (17-24 Months)
*Milestone 5: Automated cities; ecological balance; core loop closed.*

13. **[13-tactical-formation-arrays](13-tactical-formation-arrays/)** (7 Weeks): Pattern recognition, buff stacking, multi-actor triggers.
14. **[14-industrial-circuit-logic](14-industrial-circuit-logic/)** (10 Weeks): Signal propagation, logic gates, actuator interfaces.
15. **[15-ecosystem-equilibrium](15-ecosystem-equilibrium/)** (8 Weeks): Population migration, exhaustion warnings, disaster systems.
