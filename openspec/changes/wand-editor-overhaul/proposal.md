# Proposal: Refine Wand Editor & Visuals

This proposal addresses usability regressions in the Wand Editor (component stacking, connection difficulties), enables standard GraphEdit features (zoom, pan), and implements requested visual polish for projectiles and simulation.

## Goals
1.  **Editor Usability**: Fix node stacking/positioning, enable zoom/pan, improve connection interactions.
2.  **Visual Feedback**: Implement elemental visuals (Ice/Fire) and "Pure Color" style for projectiles.
3.  **Feature Completeness**: Add missing specific triggers (Collision, Timer) and a "Simulation" preview.
